# IOS_calculator
This project is a web-based replica of the iOS calculator, designed to mimic its functionality and aesthetic. The goal was to recreate the user experience of the native iOS app while using basic web technologies.

Features
Core Functionality
Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Percentage and Clear: Includes the "%" button for percentage calculations and "AC" for clearing the display.
Live Display Updates: Displays user inputs and results in real-time.
Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs gracefully with user-friendly error messages.
Project Components
Front End Design
HTML: Provides the structure of the calculator, including buttons for digits, operations, and utility functions.
CSS: Styled to closely resemble the iOS calculator, including button colors, layout, and spacing.
Responsive Design: Ensures usability on devices with varying screen sizes.
Back End Logic
Developed with JavaScript to handle:
Input Management: Processes user inputs and updates the display.
Mathematical Evaluations: Evaluates complex mathematical expressions using JavaScript's eval() function.
Error Prevention: Ensures valid expressions are evaluated and prevents crashes due to syntax errors.

Future Enhancements
Scientific Mode: Add advanced features such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponents.
Keyboard Support: Allow users to interact with the calculator using their keyboard.
Dark Mode: Implement a toggle for dark and light themes to improve user experience.
